# Project Build Documentation

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following tools and libraries installed on your system:

### Development Tools
- **CMake**: Project configuration tool.
- **Make**: Build tool.
- **g++**: C++ compiler.

### Dependencies
- **SFML**: For graphics, sound, and event handling.
- **Boost**: For thread and network operations.
- **nlohmann/json**: For JSON file management.

## Installing Dependencies

### On Linux

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

This script will check and install the necessary development tools and dependencies (OpenGL, GLUT, GLU, SFML, Boost, nlohmann/json).

### On Windows

1. Insalling prerequisites:
  - **Strawberry Pearl**
    - Download Strawberry Perl from https://strawberryperl.com/
    - Run the installer and follow the instructions
    - Verify installation: `perl --version`
  - **Python**
    - Download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
    - During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"
    - Verify installation: `python --version`
  - **Pip (via Python)**
    - Open a terminal (PowerShell or CMD)
    - Run: `py -m pip install --upgrade pip`
    - Verify installation: `pip --version`
  - **Conan (via Pip)**
    - Open a terminal
    - Run: `pip install conan`
    - Verify installation: `conan --version`
  - **CMake**
    - Download CMake from https://cmake.org/download/
    - During installation, select "Add CMake to system PATH"
    - Verify installation: `cmake --version`

2. Environment Setup:
  - Restart your terminal for PATH changes to take effect
  - Verify that all tools are accessible via command line


## Project Build

1. Clone the project repository :
   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
   cd <DIRECTORY_NAME>
   ```

2. Create a build directory :
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. Run CMake to configure the project :
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Compile the project :
   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Running the Project

After compilation, you can run the generated executables :

- For the client :
  ```bash
  ./r-type_client [ip] [port]
  ```

- For the server :
  ```bash
  ./r-type_server [port]
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter linking errors, ensure that all necessary libraries are installed and properly linked in the `CMakeLists.txt` file.
- For Windows users, ensure that library paths are correctly configured in your environment.
